    <p>Avoid assumptions. Donâ€™t assume the sexuality or gender identity of others or that all people are heterosexual and cisgender. 
    </p>
    <p>Blinders off. After taking the time to consciously reflect on our attitudes and biases, learn about the experiences of LGBTQ+ people, and identify where and how heterosexism and cissexism permeate our communities, you may feel overwhelmed by the things you begin to notice, as if the blinders have been torn away. Recognize this feeling is completely normal and seek the support of other allies. 
    </p>
<p>Confront when needed. Confront heterosexist and cissexist comments, jokes, and slurs. Through staying silent you are passively agreeing with what is being said. When confronting, educate others on how what they are saying is hurtful and suggest a way to reframe or restate.
